Can't read record in system table
Sort aborted
Out of sort memory; increase server sort buffer size
Too many connections
Out of memory; check if mysqld or some other process uses all available memory; if not, you may have to use 'ulimit' to allow mysqld to use more memory or you can add more swap space
Can't get hostname for your address
Bad handshake
No database selected
Unknown command
Server shutdown in progress
Statement has sum functions and columns in same statement
Column count doesn't match value count
Query was empty
Multiple primary key defined
Incorrect table definition; there can be only one auto column and it must be defined as a key
Can't create IP socket
Field separator argument is not what is expected; check the manual
You can't use fixed rowlength with BLOBs; please use 'fields terminated by'
Incorrect sub part key; the used key part isn't a string, the used length is longer than the key part, or the storage engine doesn't support unique sub keys
You can't delete all columns with ALTER TABLE; use DROP TABLE instead
No tables used
The SELECT would examine more than MAX_JOIN_SIZE rows; check your WHERE and use SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1 or SET SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE=# if the SELECT is okay
Unknown error
Invalid use of group function
A table must have at least 1 column
Too many columns
Cross dependency found in OUTER JOIN; examine your ON conditions

Unable to open underlying table which is differently defined or of non-MyISAM type or doesn't exist
All parts of a PRIMARY KEY must be NOT NULL; if you need NULL in a key, use UNIQUE instead
Result consisted of more than one row
This table type requires a primary key
This version of MySQL is not compiled with RAID support
You are using safe update mode and you tried to update a table without a WHERE that uses a KEY column
Can't open table
You are not allowed to execute this command in a transaction
The storage engine for the table does not support binary table dump
Binlog closed, cannot RESET MASTER
Net error reading from master
Net error writing to master
Can't find FULLTEXT index matching the column list
Can't execute the given command because you have active locked tables or an active transaction

This operation cannot be performed with a running slave; run STOP SLAVE first
This operation requires a running slave; configure slave and do START SLAVE
The server is not configured as slave; fix in config file or with CHANGE MASTER TO
Could not initialize master info structure; more error messages can be found in the MySQL error log
Could not create slave thread; check system resources
You may only use constant expressions with SET

The total number of locks exceeds the lock table size
Update locks cannot be acquired during a READ UNCOMMITTED transaction

The used table type doesn't support FULLTEXT indexes
Cannot add foreign key constraint
Cannot add or update a child row  a foreign key constraint fails
Cannot delete or update a parent row  a foreign key constraint fails

SSL parameters in CHANGE MASTER are ignored because this MySQL slave was compiled without SSL support; they can be used later if MySQL slave with SSL is started
Incorrect parameter or combination of parameters for START SLAVE UNTIL
It is recommended to use --skip-slave-start when doing step-by-step replication with START SLAVE UNTIL; otherwise, you will get problems if you get an unexpected slave's mysqld restart
SQL thread is not to be started so UNTIL options are ignored
MySQL is started in --skip-name-resolve mode; you must restart it without this switch for this grant to work
Incorrect table definition; there can be only one TIMESTAMP column with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in DEFAULT or ON UPDATE clause
